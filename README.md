# PennApps-Spring-2016
#Inspiration
We wanted to make a relevant and fun app that people would enjoy using,
which is how we came up with the Star Wars theme. (We also wanted to 
prove that Gabriela likes Kylo Ren more than Finn). This is our first 
hackathon, so we wanted to build a simple project that works end-to-end 
and have fun with a humorous hack. We're also all interested in 
hardware and thought it would be really cool to learn how to use a 
pulse sensor.

#What it does
Using a pulse sensor and an Arduino, we have designed a Buzzfeed-type quiz 
to reveal your Star Wars soulmate. The user wears a small pulse sensor 
around their fingertip while looking at photos of different characters 
from the recent movie, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. For each 
displayed image, the pulse sensor takes a certain number of samples and 
records the highest value. At the end, the character whose photo generated 
the quickest pulse - the most excitement! - is displayed as your romantic 
match.
